# Appearance

* atom-material-syntax
* atom-material-ui

For a material-like theme & syntax highlighting

Accent color can be changed in the settings

# UX

* tool-bar
* tool-bar-atom

Adds a toolbar (that I dock on the left side) with some quick access shortcuts

* auto-reveal-in-sidebar
* synced-sidebar

Improves sidebar behavior

* minimap

Display a map of the current file on the side. Made it absolute on the right side to navigate quickly

# Coding improvement

* emmet (Write a CSS selector & press tab: you get the HTML automagically)
* guess-indent (Better indenting when pasting stuff)
* highlight-selected (Hightlights other occurrences of selected text)

# Linters

* jshint (For better JS style. Don't forget to create a `.jshintrc` file in your projects to make it work)

# Git integration

* git-plus (I don't use it much yet, but it could be useful in the future)

# Others

* terminal-plus (Really useful to have a terminal — or several — inside your Atom window)
