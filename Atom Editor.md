# Quick install

```shell
apm install atom-material-ui atom-material-syntax tool-bar tool-bar-atom auto-reveal-in-sidebar synced-sidebar minimap emmet guess-indent highlight-selected jshint linter-jscs language-typescript-grammars-only atom-autocomplete-php git-plus
```


# Appearance

* atom-material-ui (Material theme, colors can be customised)
* atom-material-syntax (The syntax that goes with this theme)

# UX

* tool-bar
* tool-bar-atom (Adds a toolbar that I dock on the left side with some quick access shortcuts)
* remember-folds (Remember blocks foldings in files)
* remember-file-positions (Keeps your position in a file when you re-open it)
* auto-reveal-in-sidebar (Reveals which file is open in the sidebar)
* synced-sidebar (Improves sidebar behavior)
* minimap (Shows a map on the side with a preview of the file to navigate quickly)
* nav-panel (Shows a list of the functions/methods defined in the current file on the side to access them quickly)

# Coding improvement

* emmet (Write a CSS selector & press tab: you get the HTML automagically)
* guess-indent (Better indenting when pasting stuff)
* highlight-selected (Hightlights other occurrences of selected text)

# Syntax and autocomplete

* language-typescript-grammars-only
* atom-autocomplete-php

# Linters

* jshint (Detects JS errors. Don't forget to create a `.jshintrc` file in your projects to make it work)
* linter-jscs (For JS styleguides. Don't forget to create e `.jscsrc` file to customize it to your needs)

# Git integration

* git-plus (I don't use it much yet, but it could be useful in the future)

# Others

* platformio-ide-terminal (Stopped using it, but really useful to have a terminal — or several — inside an Atom window)
